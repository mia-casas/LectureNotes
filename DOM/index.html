DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
-- allows our JS to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page. The document object model specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it's in the browser window.

the DOM is an object oriented representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language suh as JS. The DOM covers two primary areas:
  1. Making a model HTML page
    - when the browserloads a webpage, it creats a model of the page in memory
    -the DOM specifies the way in which browsers should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree
    - the DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree itself is made up of objects
  2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
    - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser

Accessing:
    Common methods for accessing a single element:
    getElementByID()
    querySelector() -- tag, ID, class...looks for first match
    Common methods for accessing multiple elements:
    querySelectorAll()
    getELementsByClassName()
    getElementsByTagName(

Manipulating:
    Common properties/methods for working with html content:
        innerHTML
        textContent
    Common properties/methods for working with tag attributes:
        className and id
        setAttribute()
        getAttribute()

    )
