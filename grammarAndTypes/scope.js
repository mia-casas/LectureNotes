/*
Scope is how a computer keeps track of all the variables in a program. Scopes can also be nested where there is an outer scope (think global scope) that encloses an inner scope (think local scope).
IE -- think about global scope as planet Earth. Everthing belongs to or is on Earth itself. We live in Indiana, which could be considered our local scope.

// const is constant that cannot be changed
// let is scoped to the nearest ENCLOSING block; var is scoped to the nearest FUNCTION block
